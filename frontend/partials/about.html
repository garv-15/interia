      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We design interiors that feel calm, intentional, and lived in.
        Our approach is rooted in balance — between form and function,
        materials and light, aesthetics and everyday life.
      </p>

      <p>
        From individual rooms to full homes, we work closely with our clients
        to understand how a space should feel, not just how it should look.
        The result is timeless design that ages gracefully.
